                He is one of the most famous Portuguese soccer players in the world and has played for Manchester United and Real Madrid.<br/>
                He is the highest paid footballer in the world and in the history of football. Each year he earns a base salary of $40 million and extra $30 million from endorsements.<br/>
                Ronaldo was born on February 5, 1985 and was named Ronaldo after the then US President Ronald Reagan.<br/>
                He grew up in a poor family and had to share a bedroom and bathroom with his older brother and two older sisters.<br/>
                He started playing soccer at an early age when he was just eight. He was always running away from doing homework.<br/>
                He was nicknamed 'cry baby' because he felt bad when he used to pass the ball to his friends and they couldn't score.<br/>
                A very popular student in school, Ronaldo was expelled at the age of 14 for throwing a chair at his teacher who Ronaldo thought disrespected him. He then turned his entire attention to soccer and went on to become the world's greatest soccer player.<br/>
                But at the age of 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with 'racing heart'. His condition was serious and would have made him let go of football. But a surgery saved him and he went back for his training.

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>
                At the age of 17, Ronaldo played his first professional game for the 'Portuguese Super League'.<br/>
                In 2003, for the first time, Manchester United paid such a young player 12 million pounds as a signing amount. After this there has been no looking back.<br/>
                Arnold Schwarzeneggar has labelled Ronaldo as the fittest athlete in the world. His body fat ratio is just 10%!<br/>
                Ronaldo has an amazing ability to jump really high. This gives him an advantage to make goals as he can jump head and shoulders higher than other footballers.<br/>
                He can produce 5 times more G-force than a cheetah during a take-off on his jump! His free kick speed is 13.1 kmph, equivalent to a space shuttle!
